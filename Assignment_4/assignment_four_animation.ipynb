    "\n",
    "In this assignment, your goal is to develop educational visualizations / animations in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The group should pick one topic, preferably from a STEM topic (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) that you are very familiar with, and present a short lesson on this topic that includes interactive visualization tools with graphs / images.\n",
    "\n",
    "There should be at least one control element (slider, widget, form) that changes the view.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possible Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- ipywidgets (widgets and display tools)\n",
    "- matplotlib (plots and animations)\n",
    "- plotly  (plots and animations)\n",
    "- opencv2 (video and image manipulations)\n",
    "- turtle (basic geometric and algorithm visualizations)\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples to show\n",

    "- pythontutor\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements and Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For each group member, you should deliver a separate (using a different tool chain) visualization on the SAME topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the appropriateness of the tools selected for the tasks at hand.\n",
